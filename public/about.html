<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a father, musician, canoeist, and traveler. 
  I love movies, concerts, walking in the woods, and 
  visiting friends and family near and far.</p>

<p>I play baritone saxiphone in a big band called Mood Swing.  Our next performance is a dinner and dance at Club Lorelei, in town.  I also play guitar at campfires and family get-to-gethers.  My father (who is 88 years young) plays 4-string banjo, and fiddle.  Other family members play guitar, drums, keyboards, and sing as well.  YeeHa!</p>

<p>I recently bought an new (ish) car - a Rav4.  I'm a Highway Star!</p>
